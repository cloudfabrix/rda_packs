**Prerequisites**

- Install Event-Gateway. Use `rdaf event_gateway install --tag 8.1.1`.<br>
- Add the projectId in telegraf.conf in the path `/opt/rdaf/event_gateway/telegraf/config`<br>
Example:`projectId = "ab7085a8-6dda-11f0-b23b-0242ac150006"`
- Copy all Telegarf config files from the resources folder to path: `/opt/rdaf/event_gateway/telegraf/config/conf.d`<br><a href="https://github.com/cloudfabrix/rda_packs/tree/main/Fabrix%20AIOps%20Network%20Performance%20Management%20Telemetry/9.0.0/resources/telegraf_config_files" target="_blank">Click here for Telegarf Config Files</a><br>

- Add agents in ping_metrics.conf<br>
Example:
`urls = [ "10.95.140.24","10.95.140.20","10.95.140.21"]`

- Set telemetry service address by adding VM IP Address and Port in the telemetry_metrics.conf<br>
Example: `service_address = "<ip_address>:<port>"`
- For multi tenant,change the dataset name as `<customer_tag>_chassis_inventory` in RDA Enrich processor plugin in telemetry_metrics.conf<br>
Example:
```
    [[processors.rda_enrich]] 
    dataset_name = "<customer_tag>_chassis_inventory"
``` 
NOTE: `chassis_inventory` or `<customer_tag>_chassis_inventory` dataset is generated by executing the Network Topology Pipeline. Only devices listed in this dataset will be enriched with telemetry metrics.

- Copy all `Alert rules` from the resources folder to path:`Main Menu`-> `Configuration`->`RDA Administration` -> `Alert Rules` -> `Alert Rules -> Add`<br><a href="https://github.com/cloudfabrix/rda_packs/tree/main/Fabrix%20AIOps%20Network%20Performance%20Management%20Telemetry/9.0.0/resources/alert_rules" target="_blank">Click here for Alert Rules</a><br>
- Add notification channel . Go to `Main Menu-> Configuration->RDA Administration -> Alert Rules -> Notification Channels -> Add`, give the name as `telegraf_telemetry_metrics` and copy the Webhook URL from `Main Menu`-> `Configuration`->`Apps Administration -> configure -> Alert Endpoints -> asm_telemetry -> Webhook URL` and click save
